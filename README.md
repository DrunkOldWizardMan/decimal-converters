these are all .py files that i made while messing around, to use each one just read the def at the top and do the command after running it in the python interpreter
ik they probably suck i just made them while messing around
to run the binary .py the command is binary(), to run the hexadecimal one its hexadecimal() and to run base64 its base64()

To do list
1. condense all the code into one file
2. add more converters
3. make it possible to navigate between the converters without typing in commands in the interpreter
